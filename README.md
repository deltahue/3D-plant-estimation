# 3D-plant-estimation


## Git Conventions:
- Stick to the git workflow as much as possible: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow
- In order to merge a branch create a pull request for the others to review
- branch naming convention: nethz/feature_name

## Repository Structure
```nohighlight
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling. (for example processed point clouds)
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump. (images, raw datasets)
│
├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries

├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
│                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
│                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.

├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
